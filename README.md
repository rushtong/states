# States Assignment

Original requirement statement from my son's sophomore python class:

```
Make a program that will ask the user “what is a state that 
starts with x”, with x being a random letter. The program 
will then identify if the answer is a state and if the 
first letter and the answer match.
```

# Running

# Testing
